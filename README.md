This code demonstrates two ways to create a web server using Node.js. The first part uses the built-in http module to create a basic server that responds with "Hello Node JS" on localhost:3000. The second part uses the Express framework to create a more flexible server that responds with "Hello IT Students" on localhost:3001 for both the root (/) and /msg routes. Express makes it easier to handle routes and responses compared to the http module.
